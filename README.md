**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**
- Tailwind css
- PHP 7.4 or later ([https://www.php.net/](https://www.php.net/))
- MySQL 8.0 or later database server ([https://www.mysql.com/](https://www.mysql.com/))
- Text editor or preferred code editor

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Code:**

   Download the project files as a ZIP archive or clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heyabhiraj/CANMANsys/
   ```

2. **Set Up Database Connection:**

   Create a MySQL database for the canteen management system.
   Edit the `admin/config.php` file to provide your database credentials:

   ```php
   <?php

   define('DB_HOST', 'your_database_host');
   define('DB_NAME', 'your_canteen_database');
   define('DB_USER', 'your_database_username');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password');

   ?>
   ```

3. **Create Database Tables (optional):**

   If you're not using pre-defined database tables, create the necessary tables (e.g., `item_list`, `order_payment`, `item_order`, `registered_user`, etc.) using SQL scripts or within the code itself.

4. **Run the Application:**

   Place the project files in a web-accessible directory on your server.
   Access the application in your browser using the URL pointing to the index.php file (e.g., https://localhost/canteen-management-system/index.php).

**Usage**

The application's interface will guide you through managing canteen operations. You can typically perform actions like:

- **Adding/Editing Items:** Create new items or modify existing ones.
- **Managing Inventory:** Maintain stock levels and set reorder points.
- **Processing Orders:** Take and fulfill customer orders.
- **Generating Reports:** View insightful reports on sales and inventory.

**Security Considerations**

- Implement secure user authentication and authorization to restrict access to sensitive data.
- Validate all user input to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.
- Sanitize data before displaying it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Consider using prepared statements for database interactions to safeguard against SQL injection.
